# **Global Waterfowl Distribution and West Nile Virus (WNV) Risk Assessment**

## **Project Overview**

This project explores the global distribution of waterfowl species (Order: Anseriformes) and their potential role in the spread of West Nile Virus (WNV). While mosquitoes are the primary vectors of WNV, waterfowl (migratory birds) are recognized reservoirs and carriers, potentially aiding the global dissemination of the virus.

Although some studies have assessed the role of waterfowl in WNV transmission, none have leveraged comprehensive databases like BOLD (Barcode of Life Data System) to investigate the correlation between waterfowl diversity and WNV outbreaks on a global scale.

This project serves both as:

A proof-of-concept for using BOLD as a platform for species distribution monitoring.
A foundational analysis for understanding taxonomic and geographic patterns in waterfowl populations relevant to zoonotic disease spread.
